# Linear Regression in PyTorch - First ML Project
This is my first project in Machine Learning and PyTorch. 
The goal of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using PyTorch to learn a relationship between input values (`X`) and target values (`y`).

This project helped me understand:
PyTorch tensors  
Creating a dataset  
Building a simple neural network  
Training a model using gradient descent  
Evaluating and saving a trained model  
Using GPU (CUDA) for model training
